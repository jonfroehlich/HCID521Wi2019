Turns on and off Pin 3 once a second

[Blink2.ino](https://github.com/jonfroehlich/HCID521Wi2019/blob/master/DemoCode/Lecture03-PhysicalComputing1/Blink2/Blink2.ino)<br/>
Demonstrates two configurations of activating LEDs. One where the LED   anode (long leg) is pointed towards an output pin (in this case, Pin 3). In this configuration, driving Pin 3 HIGH will turn on the LED. And the second where the LED anode is connected to 5V and the cathode is connected towards Pin 4. In this configuration, driving Pin 4 HIGH will turn off the LED. See lecture slides for details.
